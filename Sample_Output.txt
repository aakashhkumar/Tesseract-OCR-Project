Person 1:

i just moved to the city last august and really
don't know many people here yet. i'm
interested in hanging out and maybe even
finding someone special. i would love to be
able to spend time together without any
drama and want to get to know each other
better. i'd love to find someone that i can
share all of these exciting things in life with
like art galleries, theatre, dinner, etc...

Person 2:

i'm an elementary school social worker and
find my job both fulfilling and frustrating. an
la native, i've also lived in the midwest and
new england. i've been in sf for about 6 years
now and love the people, politics, and food
here. but, ido miss having seasons and look
forward to my annual vacations back in the
midwest, which generally involve lounging on
a lake and drinking bell's beer. i enjoy being
fit, active, and healthy, though i do eat ice
cream for dinner on occasion.
